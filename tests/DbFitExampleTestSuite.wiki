!1 !-DbFit-! Example Test Suite

Tests an imaginary old-school finance record processing system ([[integration][https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-integration]]). The processing system transforms source system records to target system records so that the data models of these systems become compatible and target system can read source system data.

The processing system is implemented with [[Oracle PL/SQL][https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/plsql.html]] and and the public interfaces are database tables.

The high-level workflow is:

 1 Finance records produced by an external system (source system) are inserted into !style_code[INPUT]-table.
 1 Imaginary finance record processing system transforms the records from !style_code[INPUT]-table and writes the results to !style_code[OUTPUT]-table.
 1 Records from !style_code[OUTPUT]-table are read and transferred to the actual target system which will process the records for $$$.
